abstract  ="One hundred complexes have been investigated exhibiting D–X⋯A interactions{,} where X = H{,} Cl or Li and DX is the ‘X bond’ donor and A is the acceptor. The optimized structures of all these complexes have been used to propose a generalized ‘Legon–Millen rule’ for the angular geometry in all these interactions. A detailed Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theoretical analysis confirms an important conclusion{,} known in the literature: there is a strong correlation between the electron density at the X⋯A bond critical point (BCP) and the interaction energy for all these interactions. In addition{,} we show that extrapolation of the fitted line leads to the ionic bond for Li-bonding (electrostatic) while for hydrogen and chlorine bonding{,} it leads to the covalent bond. Further{,} we observe a strong correlation between the change in electron density at the D–X BCP and that at the X⋯A BCP{,} suggesting conservation of the bond order. The correlation found between penetration and electron density at BCP can be very useful for crystal structure analysis{,} which relies on arbitrary van der Waals radii for estimating penetration. Various criteria proposed for shared- and closed-shell interactions based on electron density topology have been tested for H/Cl/Li bonded complexes. Finally{,} using the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis it is shown that the D–X bond weakens upon X bond formation{,} whether it is ionic (DLi) or covalent (DH/DCl) and the respective indices such as ionicity or covalent bond order decrease. Clearly{,} one can think of conservation of bond order that includes ionic and covalent contributions to both D–X and X⋯A bonds{,} for not only X = H/Cl/Li investigated here but also any atom involved in intermolecular bonding."}
